You are helping me build a design system by converting Figma designs to code components. This repository will house reusable components and a component library for documentation.

Project structure:
- Next.js project with all code in the app/ folder (no src/ folder)
- Components should be in app/components/ organized by category (e.g., inputs, layout, feedback)
- All design tokens (colors (both primitives and semantic), typography, spacing, shadows) defined as CSS variables in app/globals.css
- Reuse existing design tokens and components whenever possible
- Use CSS modules for all component styling

When creating a new component:
- Check if related design tokens already exist in app/globals.css
- Reference global CSS variables in your component CSS modules
- Create a clean, reusable interface with appropriate props
- Document the component usage with examples
- Add the component to the design system library page

For design system implementation:
1. First, extract and implement foundational elements (colors, typography, spacing) from Figma to app/globals.css
2. Then build basic components using these variables
3. Finally, assemble more complex components from the basic building blocks

For design system library documentation:
- Each component should have its own section in the library
- Include a visual example of the component with variations
- Provide usage code snippets
- Document available props and their usage
- Group related components together (e.g., form elements, navigation)
